# re-state
## What is this?
re-state is a clojurescript library that makes it possible
to use **statecharts** in combination with [reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/). 
This is a thin layer over the statechart library [glas-state](https://github.com/glasgolia/glas-state) that uses reagent atoms for statecharts, making it easy to combine the power of reagent and statecharts.



## Status

This is pretty much still work in progress (alpha),
as I just change and extend the code on the fly when I need to for my own little projects.

## Dependencies
- glas-state 
- reagent

## Documentations
This is a  small layer above the [glas-state](https://github.com/glasgolia/glas-state) library, 
not much documentation is available. All the functions are defined in the re_state.cljs source file and contain docstrings.
If you understate the functionality in [glas-state](https://github.com/glasgolia/glas-state), then this module should be easy to understand.
